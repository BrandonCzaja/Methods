// The prototype constructor allows you to add new properties and methods the the Array() object. When constructing a property, ALL arrays will be given the property, and its value, as default. When constructing a method, ALL arrays will have this method available.

// Note: Array.prototype does not refer to a single array, but to the Array() object itself

// Note: Prototype is a global object constructor which is available for all JS objects.

// Syntax
Array.prototype.name = value;
